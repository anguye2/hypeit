      "description": "Wow... this place has really fallen far.\n\nNot even 3 years ago you could come here on a weekend and it would be PACKED. They had a consistent group of servers and cooks who kicked ass and were so friendly and on the ball. \n\nThe last two times I've visited have been sub-par and this time was unfortunately really disappointing. They had 2 servers who could've cared less about the clientele. People were literally getting up to ask for drinks, wasabi, etc. Which is ridiculous because this place is small... the servers don't have that big of a space to watch over. I think they just honestly didn't really care. \n\nThe variety of plates was almost non existent. Fruit and mussels were abundant but there wasn't even a Cali roll on the belt. My fianc√© asked for 2 plates and when we got them (freshly made) he said they tasted old and not good. \n\nThe only reason I still give this place a chance is for the calamari which is amazing. It's crisp, not chewy and the spices are something I've never had anywhere else. \n\nI am so sad this place is no longer the amazing sushi spot it once was. I'll deeply miss it.",

      "description": "the food didn't taste bad but it was hard to eat because the second thing i ordered had bones all throughout the unagi, neither my boyfriend or i have ever gotten bones at a sushi bar before this, and they accidentally charged us more than we signed for and we had to call to dispute and get it fixed, the service was really good otherwise and they were really nice about soliving the problem as soon as they could about our bill, usually i prefer sushi Akira and give it full stars, but if you're willing to pay as much as this resturaunt do yourself a favor and check out Kyoto sushi its high end and runs the same pricing as this conveyor belt sushi lounge. kyoto so far is my #1 if you can afford full rolls you'll never regret. \n\ncould be a new chef problem we also paid part cash and part card so i told the man on the phone i understand why that thing sometimes goes wrong, our manager has to solve problems like this all the time at my job where the computer accidentally charges the full amount to the card after they paid cash, its fixable and they did it",

I just got my order, No wasabi, No pickled ginger, and the entire meal stunk of old fish, worst sushi experience of my life. I thought Sushi smelled of the sea... The most awesome spicy tuna hand roll the first times ordering this time smelled awful and I couldn't bite through the rubber that was supposedly seaweed. Thoroughly disappointed, especially after recommending it to countless friends..\n\nAnd now I feel sick, never again!!!",

      "description": "Pretty disappointed with my experience here last week. My partner and I were in the area doing errands and decided to get a few plates because we were hungry. I remember eating here years ago when they first opened and it was good.\n\nNeither or us were impressed with the selection on the belt. It had lack of diversity and freshness for 6:30 on a weekday. The service was sufficient-but nothing actually kind or caring. I ordered their veggie tempura roll. I appreciate that it was made fresh, however they rolled up the steaming veggies instantly out of the fryer, which made the batter soggy and there wasn't a sauce drizzle on it like every other place does. Overall it was rather bland.\n\nBummed we wasted $30 on a mediocre dinner...but that ish happens when ya don't read reviews first.",

The rolls tasted great, though the fish was what you'd typically expect from a casual sushi joint in east Portland. \nUnfortunately, another customer ended up stealing my credit card while I was paying my bill because of the server's negligence. The server left me wondering \"wtf\" for about ten minutes while they were trying to figure out what to do (without letting me even know what happened), and the thief immediately started charging my card. \nThe server told me they would help me file a police report and give me surveillance footage. They comped my small lunch bill (I also didn't have my credit card anymore...), but they never came through with the report or footage.\n\nI'll never come back here- not because of this terrible situation, but because of how clearly they lack basic customer service skills.",

And there's some secret ingredient in there that gives it a little sweet kick. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

This was probably the worst sushi I've had in an actual restaurant. I'm not exaggerating. One they charged me for wasabi... yes. Wasabi. Then I got here over an hour before they close and they told me they weren't filling the conveyor anymore which is weird to me. But. Ok.. so I ordered some rolls and nigiri. This was easily the worst sushi i think I've ever had. The waitresses never refilled my drink the entire time I was here... Fred Meyers sushi was legitimately better than this. So disappointing.",

They did not honor their happy hour prices, or disclose the prices of their menu items. The server charged me for 2 more plates than I had ordered, and rolled her eyes when I asked for the receipt.

I placed an order for delivery and when My food arrived it was missing an item. After speaking with the owner, I was told that they would not send the remainder of my order back out. Instead I would have to go out and get food someplace else while my family ate the sushi that was delivered. For this reason and this reason along I will not step foot into this establishment nor will i ever get food delivered from this place again.  Absolutely the worst customer service ever. This place should be ashamed of them selves for their lack of responsibility to complete an order that was placed and payed for.",

Inflated pricing and SMALL portions of sushi, I come here sometimes because I live nearby but now i no longer want to be a customer.  I recently felt like I got ripped off, I ordered 2 seared salmons and 1 cream puff to go for $8.80!.  I usually dine-in and the past several times coming hasn't been that satisfying, usually leaving feeling MEH....Also, they use Cheap wasabi- doesn't have that real wasabi sting on tongue.\n\n3.  Usually cold inside and loud music, hard to hear when talking to someone.\n\n4. Servers are usually good at there Job.\n\n5.  Conveniently off 82nd. Ave.  Most restaurants off 82nd are fairly priced to cheap and Fujiyama is overpriced and they think there located off Sunnyside road in happy valley hills.\n\n6.  If I wanted to pay for overpriced sushi I would rather go to FUJI'S up the hill on sunnyside road.  At least they make there sushi fatter and there in house sauce is better.\n\n7.  Just like fake news, a lot of fake reviews on here.  Most of the great reviews are over exaggerated.  I been coming here for years and finally decided to stop supporting this place.\n\n8.  They either need to make sushi portions bigger and have the same pricing or lower pricing and keep portions the same.   Nowadays, many successful restaurants have huge portions, maybe they should follow.",

      "description": "A cautious 5 star review.\nBelt and by the order sushi. Full bar available.\nService was attentive and friendly. Inside was attractive but there was a strong smell of cleaner.\n\nI tried several of my stand-by plates that I have at any belt style sushi, and got adventurous with a few that just looked like they wanted my to try them. \n\nPlates pricing starts at $1 and goes up to $4, with the average in the $2 range for much of what my date liked. I was more adventurous and tried a the $3 plates but our average was still just a sliver of salmon over $2 per plate. \nBut, we got in before 2 pm for Happy-hour so everything was $1.85 / plate. Cool.\n\nMy date likes the House roll. It had quite a bit of tuna and crab compared to other sushi places which are mostly rice.\nMy Philadelphia roll was a little disappointing, not fresh looking and flavorful as I have had.\nThe (fake) crab salad was nicely creamy and flavorful. \nOf the three $3 plates of fancier morsels I tried, only the salmon sashimi would I recommend.\n\nIf I did not consider my date's opinion I would give them a 4 star, room for some improvement. But as she felt her food was a notch better than other sushi places, the balance is to go ahead and give a, \"cautious\" 5 stars.\n\nI look forward to returning to try again.",

      "description": "My friend was craving sushi and we were somewhat in the neighborhood, so we gave this place a try. Arrived at 6:30pm on a Monday, and the place wasn't at all packed, which was nice. Of course, we were in between happy hours. They run 3pm to 6pm and then again 8pm to 10pm. My friend jokingly said we arrived during the unhappy hours. \n\nWe were told to sit wherever we like, so we sat in front of the sushi train to scope out what they had to offer. A few of the little clear domes that go over the sushi to preserve it were horribly cloudy which made for quite the guessing game on what would be underneath. \n\nAfter a few selections off the train, we asked for a menu to see what else there was. I'm a huge fan of tempura, so I ordered the veggie tempura and the chicken tempura. Or so I thought. The first item completed was shrimp tempura, which we did not order nor want. My friend was kind enough to let them know that wasn't correct. So, they took it back and made veggie tempura...with shrimp. Eh, my friend ate the three pieces of shrimp tempura so that it wouldn't go to waste. The tempura was tasty. Once we got the bill, I noticed they charged us for shrimp tempura despite the fact we didn't order it. Oh well. I'd give this place a second try. Nothing fancy, but not bad.",

My miso soup was cold, which didn't things off to a good start. One of the soy sauce small bowls seemed dirty, and the ginger seemed old. The Long Island was on happy hour for $2.5, but you get what you pay for, so I was suspicious and expecting (and got) a mediocre drink. I was hoping for a map-menu to see what was going around on plates, but they didn't have one so each sushi choice was a complete guess. Of the 7 plates we tried, only 1-2 tasted good.

I thought that was a nice gesture so I said sure. She brought my salad and then 5 minutes later told me it was going to be a long wait. I asked why, and was told that three new orders had been placed and went in front of mine. It would now be at least another half hour until my food would be ready. I told them I didn't understand why my food was moved to the back of the line. They offered to give me a coupon for a free meal at another time.

      "description": "One of my favorite sushi spots in town! Their rice is delicious and they don't construct their sushi with too much rice or fake crab.\nWhen I'm craving the fatty sushi covered in sauces I come here, their rolls tend to be on the richer side with saucy components. \nTheir service is excellent, the ordered food comes quickly, and the staff are incredibly friendly. Everything is clean and fresh. And killer happy hour deals too!",
